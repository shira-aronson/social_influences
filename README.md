# Social Influences on Pornography Consumption
This project presents analysis of a survey-based experiment capturing the effects of two social treatments on participants' comfort with explicit vignettes. The purpose of the project was to assess how socialization can affect the consumption of pornography. Further, the project aimed to separate social interactions into their informational and social pressure components, and to assess the distinct effects of each. Overall, both social treatments were found to increase comfort with pornography vignettes among female participants, relative to a control group. In contrast, both treatments reduced comfort among male participants.

This repository includes the data analysis in python, and the final write-up which presents and interprets the results. The appendix of the final write-up additionally includes the full experiment, including the treatments, that were coded into Qualtrics. The data is not shared due to confidentiality issues.

This project was an undergradate thesis for the economics and gender and sexuality studies departments at the Univeristy of Chicago.
